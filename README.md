7.10pm - 15 minute break  

7:25pm - FinOps - Improve Java warmup & throughput and reduce Cloud infra costs without changing a line of code  
Java’s warmup problem has long been an issue in ensuring peak application performance. It makes your JVM slow to get up to speed, which results in worse end-user experiences for the users of those VMs. This talk will share techniques to bring Java applications to full speed immediately after a startup. Also, Cloud costs have been skyrocketing, and engineers/architects are looking at ways to keep these under control. This talk will share how enterprises reduce cloud costs by up to 40% without changing a line of code.
