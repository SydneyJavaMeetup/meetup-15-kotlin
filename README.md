# Sydney Java Meet-Up #15
## Kotlin!

### Program
6pm - Networking/Drinks/Food  

6:30pm - Event Intro and Job Shouts  

6:35pm - Hands off deployments in Kotlin With Acceptance Tests (Mat Johnson)  

Do you feel nervous when your code is ready to be deployed to production? Do you feel you need to manually test each deployment to ensure no regressions? This talk will share a technique to take acceptance criteria and turn it into a set of automated tests. The acceptance tests will be written using Kotlin to test a Kotlin based micro-service.  
\- Matt is a Software Artist that loves building new capabilities using Test Driven Development and automation as much as possible. Matt enjoys working with Kotlin, Java, Python, MacOS, Ubuntu, Ansible and Kubernetes.  

7.10pm - 15 minute break  

7:25pm - Streaming REST Responses with Kotlin and Ktor (Peter Wall)  

An introduction to the coroutine capabilities of Kotlin, and a demonstration of how they can be utilised to receive JSON data, process it and output response objects on the fly. The first object in a list can be deserialised and processed fully while the second and subsequent objects are still in transit.  
\- Peter is a Software Engineer; 4 years with Tyro. He's had had a long and varied career, including 6 years as a Senior Java Architect with Sun Microsystems in Australia and the US. He also has a large portfolio of Open Source Software at https://github.com/pwall567.
